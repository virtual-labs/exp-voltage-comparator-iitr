#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expositry
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description: </b> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
This experiment contains the circuit of voltage comparator and zero crossing detector. Firstly, user will connect led, supply, ground and resistances with operational amplifier in order to complete the circuit for voltage comparator and zero crossing detector. If the circuit is properly connected then user have to apply a particular value of input resistance which will divide thw supply voltage between two voltages i.e. V1 and V2 on input terminals of operational amplifier. if V1> V2 then the LED connected at the output will not glow so, user have to select a particular value of resistance above which V1 will become less than V2 and output LED on simulator will start glow.
